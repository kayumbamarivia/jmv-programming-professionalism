============================= Land Of Knowledge In Kingdom Of Wise And Intelligent Quotient People ================================================
Features : security, Mobile development, Designing, Modeling, AI, Projects, Problem finding, Solutions, Reading, Socializing, Connections, gaming, Sport(football, basketball and volleyball) and STEM
Schedule :
- Monday to Friday (Inquiring about lessons, blending, designing, and having something to code with committing to GitHub as well as having something in my cache file)
- Saturday (Sleeping enough, wash clothes, sport, get lunch, choir, other fun things).
- Sunday (Be with Stanley and other activities on Sunday)
NB:
- Every thing should start with God and end with God as He is my best Friend, We shall share each and everything.
- Some sport time after studies can be left for learning piano.
- I should follow teachers with full attention as well as asking them questions.
- Exercise notebook and Formulas book should be present.
-In inactive state I should read CPH and other books.
- No self priding and online knowledge warmers are very essential.
========================== QUOTES ========================================================
1. Simplicity is the soul of efficiency
2. Code is like humor, if you have to explain it, it is bad
3. Programming is not about what you know, but what you can figure out
4. First solve the problem algorithmically and then write codes
5. Bad worry about codes whereas good worry about DSA and their relationships
6. Talk is cheap, show me the codes
7. Programs are for humans to read, and only incidentally for machine to execute
8. Any fool can write codes but wise can write codes that humans understand
9. Before a software can be reusable, it should be used 
10. A good error message is that one that never shows up
======================== FIRST CASE =================================================================
Becoming the world‚Äôs greatest Java grandmaster will take me deep knowledge, hands-on experience, and mastery of both core and advanced Java concepts.
