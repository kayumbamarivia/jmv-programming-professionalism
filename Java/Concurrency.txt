1. What is a process?
=>An independent program executing in memory. Processes can communicate via Inter-Process Communication (IPC). Each memory has its own memory space and can take longer to execute.
2. What is a thread, thread pool, and what are three ways of creating a thread in java?
=>This is smaller unit of a process that can be executed independently. Direct communication since they share same memory and they are executed faster and context switching.
=>Thread pool is a managed group of worker threads that are reused to execute multiple threads instead of creating new threads each time.
=>Threads can be created via this built-in supports thread class, runnable interface and executor framework with executor service.
3. What is multithreading?
=>This is the process of executing multiple threads (parts of a program) simultaneously to maximize CPU utilization. We need to do so for better CPU utilization, faster execution, responsiveness for UI applications like swing and java fx, and parallel processing.
4. What are use of these famous methods  and keywords as used in threads?
a)run => where all logic to be executed is put.
b)start => starts a thread execution.
c)new fixed thread pull from executors => creates a fixed number of threads.
d)shutdown from executor service => Makes sure there no new thread submitted before existing are finished.
e)sleep => pauses a thread for a specified time.
f)join => pauses a thread to wait for other thread to finish before continuing.
g)yield => hints the scheduler to temporarily pause the current thread.
h)set daemon => marks a thread as a daemon to mean run in the background and stops when all user threads finish.
i)synchronized => puts a lock on block of code to prevent race conditions.
j)wait => pauses a thread to release a lock until it is notified.
k)lock. lock and lock. unlock => it also enables synchronization.
l)await => advanced form of wait from java. util. concurrent. locks
m)signal => advanced form of notify from locks package also.
n)notify => wakes up a waiting thread.
5. What is a deadlock and synchronized key word?
=>A deadlock is when threads are waiting for each other's resource indefinitely.
=>Synchronized keyword follows access modifier which prevents data inconsistency due to the fact that since threads share the same memory there can be race conditions.
6. What are 5 states of a thread life cycle?
-New when it is created but not started.
-Runnable ready to run but waiting for CPU time.
-Blocked waiting for a lock due to synchronized block.
-Waiting indefinitely for another thread's signal.
-Timed waiting for a specified time using sleep or join.
-Terminated has finished execution.
