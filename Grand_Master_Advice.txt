Features : Security, Mobile development, Designing, Modeling, AI, Projects, Problem finding, Solutions, Reading, Socializing, Connections, gaming, Sports and STEM
========================== QUOTES ========================================================
1. Simplicity is the soul of efficiency
2. Code is like humor, if you have to explain it, it is bad
3. Programming is not about what you know, but what you can figure out
4. First solve the problem algorithmically and then write codes
5. Bad worry about codes whereas good worry about DSA and their relationships
6. Talk is cheap, show me the codes
7. Programs are for humans to read, and only incidentally for machine to execute
8. Any fool can write codes but wise can write codes that humans understand
9. Before a software can be reusable, it should be used 
10. A good error message is that one that never shows up
======================== FIRST CASE =================================================================
My Path to Java Mastery (But other programming languages are also included === They're just the same thing in different cases) 🚀
1. Master the Core🏗️  
   - OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Interface, Instantiation, Abstraction)  
   - Collections, Generics, Streams, and Functional Programming  
   - Multithreading & Concurrency  
   - Design Patterns (Singleton, Adapter, Observer, etc.)  
   - JVM internals (Memory Management, Garbage Collection)  

2. Becoming a Backend Legend👑  
   - Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security)  
   - REST APIs & Microservices Architecture  
   - Database mastery (JPA, Hibernate, SQL, NoSQL)  
   - Messaging Systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ)  

3. Deep Dive into Performance & Optimization⚡  
   - JVM Tuning & Profiling  
   - High-performance coding techniques  
   - Reactive Programming with Project Reactor  

4. Contributing on Open Source & Build Projects🏗️  
   - Join Java open-source projects on GitHub  
   - Write technical blogs, teach others  
   - Build and showcase real-world applications  

5. Competitive Programming & Problem Solving🤯  
   - Leets code, Code forces, Hacker rank challenges  
   - Master algorithms and data structures  

6. Stay Updated & Expand Horizons🌎  
   - Java 21+ features, new libraries, and best practices  
   - Explore other Java-related domains (Android, AI/ML with Java, Game Development, etc.)  
NB: I should live a carefully life leaving behind my worries and looking for the greater good.
